This web application is a user's daily planner.

Events can be added every hour from 9am to 5pm (typical business hours) by typing in an event or task in the text area of each time block. These events are saved when the user clicks on the save button to the right of the text area where an event was typed in. These events remain on screen even if the user refreshes their web browser.

Depending on the time, each time block will change colors, with green blocks representing the future, red blocks representing the present, and grey blocks representing the past.
